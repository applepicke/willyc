# willyc.me

Hi, I'm Willy. This is my personal website. I'm assuming you want to check out my website and see what it's like. Well, you're in luck! It should be up and running at `willyc.me`.

If for some crazy reason you want to run it locally (maybe you want to make it better and submit a PR? :D) here are some instructions for how to do it!

## Prerequisites

TODO: Write up detailed install instructions

- Ruby 2.3.3
- Bundler

## Installation

```
bundle install
npm install
```

## Running

```
rails s
```

Point your browser to `localhost:3000`
